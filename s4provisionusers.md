Introduction

In order to use SAP Task Center with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, it's important that the S/4AHANA Cloud user profile has the **Global User ID** populated with a value that matches the **User UUID** field from the user profile in SAP Cloud Identity Authentication Service(IAS).  This field will normally be empty after users are onboarded in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.  For more ifnormation on S/4HANA Cloud user onboarding process, refere the links below:
