## Introduction
The described mission covers only the basic setup for SAP Task Center on SAP Business Technology Platform.

To make use of SAP Task Center as a truly central inbox for the supported SAP solutions, you need to adapt the destinations created by the booster to connect to the task provider systems that you want to use:

- Connect SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Task Center
- Connect SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Task Center
- Connect SAP S/4HANA and SAP Task Center
- Connect SAP Fieldglass and SAP Task Center

In addition to this basic mission, we'll offer subsequent missions for the task provider systems.
