## Create subaccounts manually in your global account

### Procedure

1. From your global account, choose **New Subaccount**.

2. Enter a display name.

3. (Optional) Enter a description.

4. Choose the region, environment, and infrastructure provider for your subaccount.
For more information about the availability of the service, see [SAP Task Center service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-task-center?region=all&tab=service_plan).

**Note**

The subdomain can contain only letters, digits and hyphens (not allowed in the beginning or at the end), and must be unique across all subaccounts in the same region. Uppercase and lowercase letters can be used, however that alone does not qualify as a means to differentiate subdomains for example, SUBDOMAIN  and subdomain  are considered to be the same.
The subdomain can't be changed once you have created the subaccount.

5. (Optional) To use beta features in the subaccount, choose Enable beta features.
Save your changes.

### Results

On the global account page, there is a new tile with the subaccount details. For more information, see [Create Subaccounts In Your Global Account](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/05280a123d3044ae97457a25b3013918.html).
