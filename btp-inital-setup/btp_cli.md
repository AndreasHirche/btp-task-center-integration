## Use the Command Line Interface

The Command Line Interface (CLI) for SAP BTP is an alternative to the cockpit that lets you carry out all account administration tasks on the global account and subaccount level using a command line.

If you go down the hierarchy starting with the global account, the last task in the CLI is to create environment instances, for example, a Cloud Foundry org. From here on, you need the cloud foundry CLI or Neo CLI if you want to stay in the command line.
