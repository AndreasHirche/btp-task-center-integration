#Introduction

SAP Task Center supports the user universal unique identifier (UUID) to ensure the identification of the end user in each connected system, for example, SAP S/4HANA with a unique identifier.

To support this, you are required to use the user universal unique identifier(UUID) of the [Identity Authentication service](https://help.sap.com/products/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION?version=Cloud) as the federation identifier.

For more information, see Identity Lifecycle: SAP Reference Architecture for Identity Access Management â€“ Part 2.
