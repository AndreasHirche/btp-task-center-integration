# Configure Single Sign-on in SAP Concur

## Introduction

In order to use SAP Task Center with SAP Concur we need to use SAP Cloud
Identity Services -- Identity Authentication (IAS) as an Identity
Provider to provide single sign-on to SAP Concur. To do this, we need to
establish trust between IAS and SAP Concur.
