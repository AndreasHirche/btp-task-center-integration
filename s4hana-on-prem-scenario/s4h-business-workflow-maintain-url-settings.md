| --- | ----------- |---|
| alias | System Alias | The administration manual for the SAP Fiori Launchpad provides a description of how the launchpad URL can be configured (see SAP Help Portal). The default alias /sap/bc/ui2/flp/FioriLaunchpad.html should work as long as it is not blocked by the system |
| host | Host | The host name of the SAP Fiori Launchpad server |
| port | Port | The port of the SAP Fiori Launchpad server |

*The configuration can be tested in this activity. The test can only be performed in display mode, as this is only possible for saved data.  The test UI displays the URL if a configuration has been saved and the work item exists in the system. You can test the URL by double-clicking it or copying it to the address bar in the browser.*
