# SAP S/4HANA Integration Scenario with SAP cloud Identity

Make sure you have completed the SAP S/4HANA Cloud integration with Identity Authentication Service (IAS) and Identity Provisioning Services (IPS). This integration prepares all business users for access to SAP Task Center. 

As a prerequisite, you will need to have the SAP Cloud Connector installed and connect SAP S/4HANA as well as IAS and IPS to it.
