<p ="text-align: left;">After configuring your Destination services for SAP Ariba, you need to test the integration. You can do this in the BTP Sub Account by clicking on the button that says "Test Connectivity" on the bottom left of the newly created destination. Depending on the message, you'll know if it's a success or an issue with the integration/API access/configuration. If you encounter an error, you can follow this helpful blog and troubleshoot with Postman to see if it's a connectivity issue or maybe an issue with the Identity Access Management services.</p>
